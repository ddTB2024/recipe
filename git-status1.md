## What is git status:
git-status offers a modified files that are not yet staged for commit, staged files ready to be committed, as well as untracked files that Git is not managing.
In Jupyter Lab, we can use the file browser to see file status with visual cues like icons.
Install a Git plugin for a dedicated Git interface showing modified, staged, and untracked files.Access the terminal to run git status directly for detailed status information.
